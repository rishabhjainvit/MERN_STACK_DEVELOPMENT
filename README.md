# MERN Stack Development

This project is focused on developing a strong backend using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack. The primary goal is to provide a robust backend service that handles user authentication, data storage, and API integration.

## Technologies Used

- **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. It allows for building scalable network applications.
- **Express.js**: A web application framework for Node.js, designed for building APIs and web applications with minimal setup.
- **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database that provides a flexible and scalable data storage solution for modern applications.
- **JSON Web Tokens (JWT)**: Used for authentication and authorization, providing a secure way to transmit information between parties.

## Features

- User authentication and authorization using JWT
- CRUD operations for managing data
- RESTful API design
- Data validation and error handling
- Connection to MongoDB for persistent data storage
